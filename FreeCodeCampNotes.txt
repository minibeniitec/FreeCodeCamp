Responsive Web Design
    Basic HTML/HMTL5
        Introduction to Basic HTML and HMTL5
            HTML = HyperText Markup Language
            Element = components with opening and closing tags surrounding content
                Different elements surroung different content (ex: paragraph <p></p>)
            The language was original for static documents using the browser as the navigator.
            W3 updates HTML specification so weppages remain reliable on all browsers.
        Say Hello to HTML Elements
            Elements have opening and closing tags (usually)
            <h></h> (difference is the /)
            Solution:
                <h>Hello World</h>
        Headline with the h2 Element   
            Add h2 element saying catphotoapp
            h1-h6 different heading levels
            Solution:
                <h1>Hello World</h1>
                <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
        Inform with the Paragraph Element
            p - prefered for paragraph text
            Add p "Hello Paragraph"
            Solution:
                <h1>Hello World</h1>
                <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
                <p>Hello Paragraph</p>
        Fill in the Blank with Placeholder Text
            Lorem Ipsum Text is the programmers best filler friend
            Solution:
                <h1>Hello World</h1>
                <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
                <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
        Uncomment HTML
            Comments denoted by <!-- -->
            Solution was to uncomment stuff

        Delete HTML Elements
            Literally Deleting (for "vertical space")
        Introduction to HTML5 Elements
            main, header, foot
            tags provide descriptive structure to your HTML

        Link to External Pages with Anchor Elements
            a tag is for links
            use href to specify link
            Solution:
                <a href="https://freecatphotos.org">cat photos</a>
        Link to Internal Sections of Page with Anchor Elements
            Solution: add an id then make the href="#id"
        Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph
            <a> = anchor element
            target="_blank" -opens a new tab
        Make Dead Links using the Hash Symbol
            href="#" creates a dead link
        Turn an Image into a Link
            Nest the <img> in an <a>
        Create a Bulleted Unordered List
            <ul> un-ordered bulleted list
            <li> list item
        Create an Ordered List
            <ol> ordered and numbered list
        Create a Text Field
            <input type="text">
        Add Placeholder Text to a Text Field
            placeholder attribute of input tag
        Create a Form Element
            <form> specifies a group of inputs
                action attribute sends the form data to the given link
                <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
                Note: Specify protocol
        Add a Submit Button to a Form
            <button type="submit">Text here</button>
        Use HTML5 to Require a Field
            required attribute on a form input item will not allow users to submit without the item being filled out
        Create a Set of Radio Buttons
            <label for="id_of_radio_button">
                <input type="radio" name="name_of_this_button_group">
            </label>
        Create a Set of Checkboxes
            same as radio buttons, except with type-checkbox
        Use the Value Attribute with Radio Buttons and Checkboxes
            <input value="value_of_selection_to_send_to_server">
        Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default
            <input ... checked>
        Nest Many Elements within a Single div Element
