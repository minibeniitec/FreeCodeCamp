Responsive Web Design
    Basic HTML/HMTL5
        Introduction to Basic HTML and HMTL5
            HTML = HyperText Markup Language
            Element = components with opening and closing tags surrounding content
                Different elements surroung different content (ex: paragraph <p></p>)
            The language was original for static documents using the browser as the navigator.
            W3 updates HTML specification so weppages remain reliable on all browsers.
        Say Hello to HTML Elements
            Elements have opening and closing tags (usually)
            <h></h> (difference is the /)
            Solution:
                <h>Hello World</h>
        Headline with the h2 Element   
            Add h2 element saying catphotoapp
            h1-h6 different heading levels
            Solution:
                <h1>Hello World</h1>
                <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
        Inform with the Paragraph Element
            p - prefered for paragraph text
            Add p "Hello Paragraph"
            Solution:
                <h1>Hello World</h1>
                <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

            Solution:
                <h1>Hello World</h1>
                <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
